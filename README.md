##  📖 About

For me the symbolic links is a useful feature of macOS. They can be especially useful when it's needed to store the `Documents` folder on a hard drive or SD card, but on the ssd to create a just link to this folder.
Create Symlink is a mac Automator workflow which allows to create symbolic links of selected folders or files. It can be added to the "Services” menu and called by right-clicking on selected folders or files and selecting `Services --> create symlink` from the context menu.

**There is an alternative project with similar functionality, but a different implementation - a `Finder extension`.; for more details see https://github.com/ololx/quick-symlink.**
